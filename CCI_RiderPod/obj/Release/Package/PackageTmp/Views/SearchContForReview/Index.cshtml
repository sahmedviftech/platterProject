                            Why reviews are important

                        @*<p>
                            Clear and honest reviews are an enormous benefit for consumers researching potential contractors, roofers, electricians, plumbers and other home improvement companies. Your positive/negative experience helps other homeowners make the right hiring choices and impacts the contractor's Homii rating. While you are free to write whatever you want - as long as it meets our Review Guidelines, we request you to be objective and factual in your judgment. After you've reviewed their performance, please also rate the contractor for their quality of work, timeliness, cleanliness, budget, communication, and courteousness. Your review will help us and other homeowners differentiate between trusted professionals and others.
